webdeploy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides a command-line tool for deploying a website on a web
server. It employs NodeJS and libgit2. Configuration for the deployments is kept
in the bare repository's 'config' file.

This project is based off of `gitsync`. See https://git.rserver.us/utils/gitsync.

Methodology

This is a lightweight tool that implements a deployment pipeline. The pipeline
operates on the filesystem OR a git repository tree (This is collectively called
the "target tree"). The pipeline's job is to map certain targets within the
target tree to their respective output varients. This can be as simple as
copying a file to an output directory, or converting the content's of the
specified file to a usable/convenient format.

The pipeline process contains two primary steps: build and copy. The build phase
is optional as it involves transforming a target into one or more output targets.

A more granular description of the pipeline follows:

    0.1 Find a webdeploy.config.js file in the target tree. This file is used to
        specify how the project is to be built for deployment. This file should
        be committed into the repository. It is only needed for files that need
        to be built.

    0.2 Load configuration from the repository's config file. If the target tree
        is not a git repository, then this step does nothing.

    1.  Search the target tree recursively for targets matching rules defined by
        the configuration gathered in step 0.

    2.  Execute the handlers for each target.

    3.  Execute the deployment for each target.
